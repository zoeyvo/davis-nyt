What A we tool did you use?
    We used GitHub Copilot.

How did you use it? What kind of questions did you ask? (include links to your conversation if applicable)
    We used GitHub Copilot to assist with understanding and working with tools that were new to us, including:

    - Svelte, Vite, and Web Unit Testing Frameworks (e.g., Vitest): Copilot provided example snippets, suggested test structures,     and offered autocomplete support as we explored how to set up and write tests for Svelte components.
    - SCSS Refactoring: We used Copilot to help refactor CSS from Assignment 1 into SCSS. This included generating variable     declarations, restructuring with nesting, and organizing styles for better modularity and scalability.

We did not rely on Copilot to generate complete solutions but used it as a tool for guidance, learning, and increased productivity
